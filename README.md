# Hangman
This is a classic Hangman game. In the original game you play this with a friend that choose the hidden word. In this case the computer randomizes a word for you, and it's your job to guess the word before you run out of guesses.

## Planning 
### Flowchart
-   Before i started this project i made a flowchart to make sure that i knew what i wanted to code and what the code should do. 
This made me start the project with a plan and a starting point for my game.
I made changes along the way. Espacially to make it better for the user with user stories in mind. But this flow chart was the starting point for the project.
### User stories
- When i started this project i sat down to think about what i needed to do to make this game better, more fun and smoother for the user. I came up with the following things that i wanted to implement to make this happen.
- User Stories
    -   I want the user to input their name and make it come back during the game accomplish the feeling that the game is for the user.
    -   I want the user to know when and why the the input wasn't valid. So i made sure that this was clear in the messages. 
    -   I want the user to see what letters they already guessed so they don't need to remember that to themselves. Would be irritatin with a error message that they already guessed a letter if they can't see the previous guesses. 
    -   I want the user to be able to play again without refreshing the page. So i added the option after the game finishing to type "y" to play again.
