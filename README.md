# Hangman
This is a classic Hangman game. In the original game you play this with a friend that choose the hidden word. In this case the computer randomizes a word for you, and it's your job to guess the word before you run out of guesses.

# Planning 
**Before project start**
-   Before i started this project i made a flowchart to make sure that i knew what i wanted to code and what the code should do. 
This made me start the project with a plan and a starting point for my game.
I made changes along the way. Espacially to make it better for the user with user stories in mind. But this flow chart was the starting point for the project.
